## 1. Timely delivery is very crucial in software project due to following reasons: Cost Control: Extended timelines can lead to increased costs, as delays often require additional resources like labor, equipment, or even contract extensions with vendors. Staying on schedule helps manage and reduce project costs. Resource Management: Project timelines are often planned around available resources. Delays in one project can affect the availability of resources for future projects, leading to a cascading effect on other initiatives. Scope Creep: When projects stretch beyond their intended timeline, there's a greater chance of scope creep (the addition of new features or changes not originally planned). This can further delay delivery and increase costs. Client Satisfaction: Clients expect projects to be delivered on or before agreed deadlines. Delays can harm relationships, lead to dissatisfaction, and sometimes cause financial penalties or legal disputes. Project managers can ensure that deadlines are met through using following methodsUse of Project Management Tools: Tools like Jira, Trello, Asana, and Microsoft Project,Effective Communication,Regular Monitoring and Progress Reporting,Resource Allocation and Management Clear Planning and Goal Setting,risk management , Prioritization and Scope Control.

## 2. Effective cost control contributes much in the success of software project as It helps maintain financial stability, optimizes resources, enhances client satisfaction, and reduces risks. Strategies to prevent budget overruns include:Contigency planning, impliment strict change management, detailed projject planning, resource management,Leverage Automation Tools.

## 3. Agile and waterfall methodologies Waterfall:Linear and Sequential: Waterfall is a linear, step-by-step approach where each phase of development (requirements, design, development, testing, and deployment) is completed before moving on to the next. Phases are fixed: Once a phase is completed, going back to it is difficult and costly. Heavy documentation: Extensive documentation is required for each phase, making the process structured and rigid.                Agile:                                                              Iterative and Incremental: Agile is an iterative approach where the project is divided into smaller cycles or "sprints" (typically 1-4 weeks long), allowing for continuous improvement and flexibility.Adaptive and flexible: Agile allows for constant change and adaptation based on feedback throughout the development process.                  Less documentation: Documentation is minimized in favor of collaboration and working prototypes.                                Waterfall Advantages:                                                  Clear structure and documentation: Provides a well-defined path with thorough documentation, making it easier for new team members to understand.                                                      Predictable timelines and budgets: More control over cost and time, as everything is planned in advance.                               Simplicity in smaller projects: Ideal for projects with stable, clear, and well-defined requirements.                                        Waterfall Disadvantages:                                           Inflexibility: Difficult to adapt to changes once the project is in motion, especially for long-term projects.                        Delayed Testing: Bugs and issues are often detected late in the development cycle, making fixes more costly.                     Customer feedback comes late: Clients may not see the product until late in the process, which can lead to dissatisfaction if the end result doesnâ€™t meet expectations.                                       Agile Advantages:                                             Flexibility: Agile adapts well to changing requirements and customer feedback, making it ideal for dynamic projects.               Continuous improvement: Regular feedback cycles allow for iterative improvements, resulting in a more refined final product.            Early and frequent deliveries: Agile delivers working product increments early, giving stakeholders more visibility into the progress.Agile Disadvantages:                                         Unpredictability: Costs and timelines can be harder to predict since Agile thrives on flexibility.                                                        Requires high involvement: Agile requires continuous customer and team engagement, which may be challenging for some stakeholders. Can be chaotic without strong leadership: Without proper management, Agile projects can veer off course or experience scope creep.



## 4. Waterfall is best suited for projects with well-defined, unchanging requirements, predictable outcomes, and minimal need for mid-project changes. It's ideal for industries like construction or manufacturing, where rigid processes are essential.                Agile is ideal for projects that require flexibility, rapid iteration, and adaptability, particularly in software development, where customer feedback and changing requirements are common.





## 5. Followign are methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout the software project: Establish clear requirements, develop a quality assurance plan, automated testing, manual testing,security testing, performance testing, regretion testing, continuous monitoring. It is important to mantain high standards for delivering quality products, building trust with customers, and ensuring long-term success. It reduces risks, enhances efficiency, encourages innovation, and fosters a culture of continuous improvement. High standards not only benefit the organization in the short term but also ensure sustainability, competitiveness, and positive market impact in the long run.


## 6. Defining project scope contributes successful project planning by helping in setting clear objectives, prevents scope creep, accurate resource planning, defining timeframes and schedule, helps in budget estimation, improves risk management,facilitates communication and stakeholders alignment, guides on decision making. Work breakdown structure is an essential project management tool that organizes and defines the total scope of a project by breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks and deliverables.WBS is useful because it prevents scope creep, improves project planning,increases accountability, helps with risk management, supports resource allocation, enhances communication.

## 7. Developing detailed schedule has advantages which includes improved time management, enhanced communication, efficient use of resources, better monitoring and control, cost management, risk mitigation, client and stakeholders satisfaction. Gantt chart are usefull as they provide Visual Representation of the Schedule, task breakdown and organization, task dependencies, resource allocation, and milestone identification.


## 8. Core issues that the software needs to address are main problems that exist in the society that the software provides the solution for.The problems are significant to the targeted audience so that they get the overall picture of what the software is going to address.

## 9.Clearly defining the problem helps in developing more efficient n software solution because helps in focusing on user needs, avoiding scope creep, identification of key requirements, clear objectives and goals, efficient use of resources, improved communication.


## 10. Software solution can be described in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details by using 



## 11. Main features or functionalities that make your software stand out are key services that the software does or delivers to users which make it unique from existing softwares , can be new service or improved services from the existing ones.



## 12. It is important to know the available data about theexistingmarket that is how many people may use your solution that is the real targeted current users and also the foresee the future if there are any trends or possibility for growth which helps id determining the sustainability of the software.


## 13. Understanding market trends provide the overview of the position and development of the software as it sets the development technology to be used according to the market, also it provides the clear picture about the sustainability of the software, provides clear picture of changes that are likely to occur in future for the existing software,
